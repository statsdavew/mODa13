      "contents": "\n\n\n\nThe scientific workshops on model-oriented data analysis and optimum design (mODa) provide a high-level international forum for researchers, professionals and practitioners to present and discuss recent advances, new techniques and applications in the field of optimum experimental design. In addition, a primary aim is to provide young researchers an opportunity to establish personal contacts with leading specialists in the field. Its specificity is that the participation is by invitation of the board only.\n\nmODa is (generally) organized every three years, with the previous mODa12 held in Smolenice, Slovakia. After a short Covid-induced delay, the 13th edition of the workshop series will be held in Southampton, UK, 9-14 July 2023.\nSupported by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nAccomodation\nAccomodation for the workshop is in single ensuite rooms in Chamberlain Hall.\n\n\n\nCheck-in on Sunday 9 July: if you arrive between 15.00 and 19.00, you can pick up your room key from the Post Room in the main entrance to Chamberlain Hall (B block).\nIf you arrive after 19.00 on Sunday, you will need to pick up your key from the 24 hour reception in the Glen Eyre Halls complex (across the road from Chamberlain, in J block).\n\n\n\nCheck-in on other days: is available from 15.00. Please collect your key from the Glen Eyre reception.\nChamberlain is about a 10 minute walk from the workshop venue, Building 100 on Highfield Campus.\n\n\nThe U2 bus runs between Chamberlain Hall and Highfield Campus, and stops adjacent to Building 100. Out of term (which we very much are), the first U2C bus leaves Chamberlain at 07.25 (perfect for breakfast), then at 08.30 and then every 30 minutes (until 18.00). Returning, the U2B bus is also every 30 minutes, at 20 and 50 minutes past the hour until 17.50. There are then further buses at 18.50 and 19.50 (unfortunately, there isn’t a bus after dinner).\nThe bus journey takes about 15 minutes, due to roadworks currently underway at the junction of Glen Eyre and Burgess Roads. Note that the U2B bus back to Chamberlain takes a more scenic route.\nWorkshop venue\nThe workshop will be held on Level 4 of Building 100 (the Centenary Building) on Highfield Campus. Talks will be held in Lecture Room B (4011), with the Seminar room (4013) used for refreshments and the Tuesday poster display.\nBuilding 100 closes each day at 18.00.\n\n\n\nBreakfast, lunch and dinner\nPlease bring your workshop badge to all meals.\nBreakfast will be in the Piazza (Building 42, Students Union) between 07.30 and 08.30 each day (for residents only).\nLunch will also be in the Piazza between 12.30 and 13.30 each day, with the exception of Wednesday when a packed lunch will be provided for the excursion to Winchester.\n\n\nDinner will be in the Terrace Restaurant (Building 38) on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday between 19.30 and 20.15.\n\n\nWorkshop reception and dinner on Thursday will be held in the Harley Suite (Building 38) between 19.30 and 22.00.\nWelcome reception and BBQ on Sunday will be held in Glen Eyre Hall, on the main quad. Glen Eyre is directly across the road from Chamberlain - cross the road, and follow the signs to reception. You should then spot the BBQ on the quad.\nAfter dinner the Bridge Bar (Building 42 Students Union) will be open each day (Monday - Thursday). Other local pubs include the Crown Inn and the Brewhouse and Kitchen.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional information\nWifi is available on Campus and at Chamberlain Hall - Eduroam or the Guest network.\nHighfield Campus is adjacent to Southampton Common, 365 acres of parkland ideal for walking or the traditional mODa football game.\nAvenue Campus (a 15 minute walk from Building 100) has tennis courts that will probably not be too busy out of term.\n\n\nRadio Taxis is a reliable local taxi company. Uber also operates in Southampton.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nThe 13th mODa workshop will be hosted by the Southampton Statistical Sciences Research Institute (S3RI) at the University of Southampton Highfield Campus.\n\n\n\nThere has been an institution of higher education (the Hartley Institute) in Southampton since 1862, with a University College at the main Highfield Campus since 1919. The University gained it’s Royal Charter in 1952. S3RI was formed in 2003 to synergise the research of statisticians across the Mathematical, Social and Health Sciences, and Medicine. It will be celebrating its 20th anniversary when mODa13 is held.\nThe scientific sessions of mODa will be held in Building 100 (the Centenary Building), opened in 2019 to celebrate 100 years of higher education on the Highfield Campus. Accommodation will be in Chamberlain Halls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nParticipants should travel to Chamberlain Hall for accomodation check-in and, on Sunday evening (9 July), workshop registration and the welcome reception.\n\n\nTrain\nThe closest station is Southampton Airport Parkway which is on the mainline from London. If you are arriving via Gatwick, there are services instead into Southampton Central. From either station, you can get the U1 bus to Highfield Campus (U1C from Parkway, U1A from Central), which is a short walk to Chamberlain Hall. From Southampton Central, you can get the U2B bus direct to Chamberlain. Taxis are also available from both stations (there tend to be more at Central).\nAs there is a direct bus from Central Station to Chamberlain (and more taxis), you may find it easier to alight there.\nAirports\nFrom London Heathrow, the most convenient connection to Southampton is via the National Express Coach. Direct coaches take about two hours and stop on Burgess Road next to Highfield Campus. From London Gatwick, there are Southern Railway services to Southampton Central (see above). Please be aware that engineering work quite often takes places on a Sunday and may disrupt your journey.\nSouthampton Airport is situated on the edge of the city, and connected to Highfield Campus by the U1C bus or via taxis (which must be booked at the desk inside the terminal). It has flights from many major UK cities, Amsterdam and Paris.\n\n\n\n",
