In addition, a primary aim is to provide young researchers an opportunity to establish personal contacts with leading specialists in the field. Its specificity is that the participation is by invitation of the board only.\n\nmODa is (generally) organized every three years, with the previous mODa12 held in Smolenice, Slovakia. After a short Covid-induced delay, the 13th edition of the workshop series will be held in Southampton, UK, 9-14 July 2023.\nSupported by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nThe 13th mODa workshop will be hosted by the Southampton Statistical Sciences Research Institute (S3RI) at the University of Southampton Highfield Campus.\n\n\n\nThere has been an institution of higher education (the Hartley Institute) in Southampton since 1862, with a University College at the main Highfield Campus since 1919. The University gained it’s Royal Charter in 1952. S3RI was formed in 2003 to synergise the research of statisticians across the Mathematical, Social and Health Sciences, and Medicine. It will be celebrating its 20th anniversary when mODa13 is held.\nThe scientific sessions of mODa will be held in Building 100 (the Centenary Building), opened in 2019 to celebrate 100 years of higher education on the Highfield Campus. Accommodation will be in Chamberlain Halls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nParticipants should travel to Chamberlain Hall for accomodation check-in and, on Sunday evening (9 July), workshop registration and the welcome reception.\n\n\nTrain\nThe closest station is Southampton Airport Parkway which is on the mainline from London. If you are arriving via Gatwick, there are services instead into Southampton Central. From either station, you can get the U1 bus to Highfield Campus (U1C from Parkway, U1A from Central), which is a short walk to Chamberlain Hall. From Southampton Central, you can get the U2B bus direct to Chamberlain. Taxis are also available from both stations (there tend to be more at Central).\nAirports\nFrom London Heathrow, the most convenient connection to Southampton is via the National Express Coach. Direct coaches take about two hours and stop on Burgess Road next to Highfield Campus. From London Gatwick, there are Southern Railway services to Southampton Central (see above). Please be aware that engineering work quite often takes places on a Sunday and may disrupt your journey.\nSouthampton Airport is situated on the edge of the city, and connected to Highfield Campus by the U1C bus. It has flights from many major UK cities, Amsterdam and Paris.\n\n\n\n",
