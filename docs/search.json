In addition, a primary aim is to provide young researchers an\nopportunity to establish personal contacts with leading specialists in\nthe field. Its specificity is that the participation is by invitation of\nthe board only.\n\nmODa is (generally) organized every three years, with the previous\nmODa12 held in Smolenice, Slovakia. After a short Covid-induced delay,\nthe 13th edition of the workshop series will be held in Southampton, UK,\n9-15 July 2023.\n\n\n\n",
