The [U2](https://www.unilinkbus.co.uk/services/UNIL/U2B?date=2023-07-10&direction=inbound) bus runs between Chamberlain Hall and Highfield Campus, and stops adjacent to Building 100. Out of term (which we very much are), the first U2C bus leaves Chamberlain at 07.25 (perfect for breakfast), then at 08.30 and then every 30 minutes (until 18.00). Returning, the U2B bus is also every 30 minutes, at 20 and 50 minutes past the hour until 17.50. There are then further buses at 18.50 and 19.50 (unfortunately, there isn't a bus after dinner).

The bus journey takes about 15 minutes, due to roadworks currently underway at the junction of Glen Eyre and Burgess Roads. Note that the U2B bus back to Chamberlain takes a more scenic route.

## Workshop venue

The workshop will be held on Level 4 of [Building 100](https://data.southampton.ac.uk/building/100.html) (the Centenary Building) on [Highfield Campus](https://maps.southampton.ac.uk/). Talks will be held in Lecture Room B (4011), with the Seminar room (4013) used for refreshments and the Tuesday poster display.

Building 100 closes each day at 18.00.
